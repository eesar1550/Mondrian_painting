# Mondrian_painting
Pieter Cornelis Mondriaan (7 March 1872 â€“ 1 February 1944), known after 1906 as Piet Mondrian, was a Dutch painter and art theoretician who is regarded as one of the greatest artists of the 20th century. He was one of the pioneers of 20th-century abstract art, as he changed his artistic direction from figurative painting to an increasingly abstract style, until he reached a point where his artistic vocabulary was reduced to simple geometric elements.The painting below is a copy of one of his famous paintings.
